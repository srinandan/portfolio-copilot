# Concise code

Applies to all code in this repo (`orchestrator/`, `gateway/`, `frontend/`).

## Rules

1. **Prefer the straightforward implementation.** Don't introduce an
   interface, abstraction layer, or generic type until there are at least
   two concrete cases that need it. A single implementation doesn't need
   an interface in front of it "for testability" — use a real fake/mock at
   the call site instead if needed.

2. **One function, one job.** If a function needs a comment to explain
   what its middle section does, that section is probably a function.
   Flag (don't silently accept) any function over ~50 lines or file over
   ~400 lines — either is a signal to split, not a hard rule to enforce
   blindly.

3. **No dead code.** No commented-out code, no unused functions "in case
   we need them later," no speculative config options without a caller.
   Delete it; git history is the archive.

4. **Errors are handled, never swallowed.** Go: every error is either
   returned (wrapped with `fmt.Errorf("doing X: %w", err)` for context) or
   explicitly handled — never `_ = err` or a bare ignored return. No
   generic `catch (e) {}` blocks in TypeScript.

5. **Standard library over dependency, dependency over hand-rolled.** In
   that order of preference. Don't add a package for something the Go
   stdlib or a few lines of idiomatic code already does well.

6. **Naming says what, types say shape.** Avoid Hungarian-style or
   redundant naming (`stringName`, `dataObj`). A name plus its type
   signature should make a comment unnecessary for straightforward code.

## Anti-patterns to flag in review

- A new interface with exactly one implementation and no test double
  using it
- A config struct with fields nothing reads yet
- A generic `utils.go` / `helpers.ts` grab-bag file
- Deep nesting (>3 levels) instead of early returns / guard clauses
